# Flex Panels Image Gallery

This tutorial was a great look at using flexbox to create a gallery of image panels that - when opened - bring the text in from the top and bottom and expand the panel.

Also mentioned was Wes Bos' free twenty (20) video course on flexbox at [https://flexbox.io](https://flexbox.io).
