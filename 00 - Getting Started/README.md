# Getting Setup

This thirty (30) day challenge kicks off with a ~3:55 video.

I've opted to download the starter files from Wes' original repo at [https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30) and include them within my project for reference. Granted, this means I won't be privy to any updates unless I manually bring them in...but I'm OK with that.
